# Integrated Land and Real Estate Digitalization and Fraud Prevention System

## üìú Overview
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive documentation set for the **Integrated Land and Real Estate Digitalization and Fraud Prevention System**. The system is designed to leverage AI and Blockchain to ensure secure, transparent, and fraud-resistant land and real estate transactions.

The project was developed as part of a **Software Requirement Engineering (SRE)** course and includes the following deliverables:
- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
- **Wireframes**
- **Industry Tour Insights**

## üîë Key Deliverables
### 1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Detailed definition of system functional and non-functional requirements, user roles, and integration of AI and blockchain technologies.

### 2. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Detailed breakdown of product features, vision, and phases.

### 3. Wireframes
High-fidelity wireframes for user interfaces and workflows.

### 4. Industry Tour Insights
Experience from visiting **Vivasoft Company** and interaction with **Mr. Imrul (Business Analyst)** for real-world insights.
